## üêã Installation
### Docker
Paste this command:
```
docker run -d \
  --name tasks.md \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TITLE="" `#optional` \
  -e BASE_PATH="" `#optional` \
  -e ENABLE_LOCAL_IMAGES=false `#optional` \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/cards/:/api/files/ \
  -v /path/to/styles/:/api/static/stylesheets/ `#optional \
  -v /path/to/images/:/api/images/ `#optional \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  baldissaramatheus/tasks.md
```
Remove the optional variables and paths you don't want to keep, remove `#optional` flags for the ones you want to keep, replace `/path/to/something` with directories that exist in your filesystem, then run it. If you decide to set the optional env variable `ENABLE_LOCAL_IMAGES` as `true`, you should also map a volume for `:/api/images/` since Tasks.md does not delete local images when a card is deleted.

### docker-compose
For docker-compose, you can see an example [here](https://github.com/BaldissaraMatheus/Tasks.md/blob/main/examples/docker-compose.yaml). Use the Docker section above as reference for optional variables and volumes.

## üé® Customize
All CSS files are available in the public stylesheets directory, which can be mounted as a docker volume. It already comes with 3 color themes: [Adwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/named-colors.html), [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) and [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin). To use them, open the file `/stylesheets/index.css` and change the second line to the path of the color theme you want, you can find them under `/stylesheets/color-themes`.

## üíª Technology stack
With the goal of having a good mix of performance and maintainability, the application was built with [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) and [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa). It also uses [Stacks-Editor](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks-Editor) for text editing and [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) to serve the css files as-is.
